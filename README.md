Project: NBA points prediction app

Very simple pytorch project which takes a csv of a players stats from the current season and makes a prediction 
of how many points the player will score next game

It has 11 input nodes (the last 10 games pts count and a home or away node 0 or 1)

2 different players csv in directory - will add more
    - Jordan Poole (warriors)
    - Franz Wagner (magic)

You can save model weights or reset them depending on how you want
to play with it

The weights are currently saved to for Franz Wagners model, not Jordan Poole

For the cavs vs magic game today at 5:30pm 4/6 it predicts Wagner to score 18.91 points
